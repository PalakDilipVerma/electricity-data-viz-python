## Preview of Visualizations

### Bar Graph of Electricity Generation data (Fossil fuels vs Clean fuels) for Asia region

Electricity Generation Data for sub-category Aggregate fuel has been visualized for the continent Asia in a stacked bar graph as shown below:

### Pie Chart showing comparsion of Electricity Generated using various sources

In the below Pie Charts, we have compared detailed breakdowns of Electricity Generation data for for 2 countries - India, which is considered to have a developing economy and USA, which is considered to be a developed economy, for the years 2000 and 2021. This helps us understand the changes in choice of Fuels used to generated electricity made by those 2 countries over 20 years and also how those 2 countries compared to each other in 2000 and 2021.

### Scatter Plot showing Total Emissions and Emissions Intensity for the 4 highest GDP countries

Below 2 scatter plots show Total Emissions from the generation of electricity (in metric tons of CO2) and the Emissions Intensity (in grams of CO2 per kiloWatt-hour of electricity generated) for the 4 countries with the highest GDP in 2022.
