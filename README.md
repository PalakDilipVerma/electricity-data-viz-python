## Pie Chart showing comparsion of Electricity Generated using various sources

In the below Pie Charts, we have compared detailed breakdowns of Electricity Generation data for for 2 countries - India, which is considered to have a developing economy and USA, which is considered to be a developed economy, for the years 2000 and 2021. This helps us understand the changes in choice of Fuels used to generated electricity made by those 2 countries over 20 years and also how those 2 countries compared to each other in 2000 and 2021.
